# International Checkers Game

Team members: Kaif Kassam, Patricia Escobar, Azucena Ventimilla

In this project, we created a checkers game using a 10x10 board. In our game, there are two players represented by two different colors: red and blue, who are competing against each other.
The main purpose of the game is to win by jumping over the other players' chips and landing on an empty square, with the objective of “eating” the piece that was jumped over. The first player to “eat” all the chips wins the game. 

To play this game, a version of Java 17/21 needs to be installed. Once this is done, our main class, the “Checkers” class, can be run to play the game. At first, a canvas with our board and the chips will be displayed. To the right of the canvas, there will be a text indicating whose turn (red or blue), together with the count of the chips that each player has. Following the traditional checker rules, the “red” player will start the game, and then change turns to the blue, and vice versa. 

For the creation of this project, we would like to thank the help of our instructor, Paul Cantrell. Without his help, the final version of our ideas would not have been as effective as they are now.

While starting the game, we encountered several challenges that affected how our project finally developed. As a result, some of the features of the original checkers version are not included. 
As an example, in our game, we do not have a “king” piece, meaning that when one piece reaches the end of the other side, no additional movements are added to that piece. At the same time, we were able to develop a winning logic; unfortunately, we were not able to figure out a proper way to display this on the screen. As a team, we decided to acknowledge these as a limitation in the scope of the project and focused on implementing other core components, such as the valid movements, eating the opponent pieces, and the turns logic. Fortunately, we have been able to produce a final project that makes us proud, considering all the challenges we faced.

As a group, we acknowledge that some of the limitations of our project are related to accessibility. Since our game heavily relies on colors (red and blue) to distinguish between players, it can disadvantage users with color vision deficiencies. At the same time, our interaction is entirely mouse-based, which might mean that users who rely on assistive technologies or keyboard navigation might not be able to use it.
